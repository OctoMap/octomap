OVERVIEW
--------

OctoMap consists of two separate libraries each in its own subfolder:
**octomap**, the actual library, and **octovis**, our visualization libraries and tools.
This README provides an overview of both, for details on compiling each please 
see [octomap/README.md](octomap/README.md) and [octovis/README.md](octovis/README.md) respectively.
See http://www.ros.org/wiki/octomap and http://www.ros.org/wiki/octovis if you 
want to use OctoMap in ROS; there are pre-compiled packages available.

You can build each library separately with CMake by running it from the subdirectories, 
or build octomap and octovis together from this top-level directory. E.g., to
only compile the library, run:

    cd octomap
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
  
To compile the complete package, run:

    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
  
Binaries and libs will end up in the directories `bin` and `lib` of the
top-level directory where you started the build.

Alternatively, you can build and install octomap using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    ./vcpkg install octomap

The octomap port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

See [octomap README](octomap/README.md) and [octovis README](octovis/README.md) for further
details and hints on compiling, especially under Windows.
