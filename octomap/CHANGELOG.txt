v1.2: 2011-08-XX
===================
 - divided code into a library (octomap) and visualization part (octvis) to 
	remove dependencies on Qt / OpenGL from library. Both can be built 
	independently or as a complete package.
 - iterators for fast and flexible tree access (check doxygen of OcTreeBase::
	 iterator) are the preferred way to traverse tree nodes now
 - improved speed of map update / scan insertion. A further speedup is possible
	when using the "lazy evaluation" flag for batch insertion
 - unit tests ("make test")
 - CMake improvements: new targets "dist" (build package) and "uninstall",
	dynamic and static libs are built. CMake package config to ease integration 
	into other CMake-based systems (install octomap globally, or set the 
	environment variable octomap_DIR to your OctoMap location
 - occupancy and sensor parameters are now a property of the tree and not the
	nodes. Use e.g. tree->isNodeOccupied(node) instead of node->isOccupied()
 - cleanup of OcTree and OccupancyOcTree: the latter now holds most 
	implementation to ease deriving own tree and node types. See OcTreeStamped
	for an example.
 - debug output is now muted when not compiling as "Debug", ROS logging levels
	are used when compiled in ROS
 - experimental change detection in occupancy octrees 
 - bugfixes and general compatibility improvements

v1.0: 2011-03-15
===================
 - cleanup of insertScan methods
 - key-based raycasting with pre-allocated KeyRay
 - speedup and cleanup of math, inlining


v0.8: 2010-11-16
===================
 - improved speed of map update / scan insertion 
 - improved speed of map queries (isOccupied / castRay)
 - key-based computations to fix numerical stability and speed issues
