v1.9.2: 2019-11-28
==================
- Fixed ROS buildfarm failures for octovis

v1.9.1: 2019-11-23
==================
- Improved compatibility with modern compilers and ROS2

v1.9.0: 2017-04-28

- Added optimized rendering option and command line option for tree cutoff 
  in octovis (thx to F. Endres)

v1.8.1: 2017-01-13
==================
- Disambiguated isnan (C++11)
- Fixed #123: Set root=NULL in clear()
- Fixed #131: Portable binary read/write of Pointcloud and ScanGraph (uint32_t)

v1.8.0: 2016-04-20
==================
- Fixed #98: The tree structure in memory is now maintained in OcTreeBaseImpl to 
  enable safely deriving custom node classes. The following functions were 
  moved from OcTreeDataNode into OcTreeBaseImpl:
    createChild(...) -> OcTreeBaseImpl::createNodeChild(...)
    getChild(...)    -> OcTreeBaseImpl::getNodeChild(...)
    expandNode()     -> OcTreeBaseImpl::expandNode(...)
    pruneNode()      -> OcTreeBaseImpl::pruneNode(...)
    hasChildren()    -> OcTreeBaseImpl::nodeHasChildren(...)
    childExists(...) -> OcTreeBaseImpl::nodeChildExist(...)
    collapsible()    -> OcTreeBaseImpl::isNodeCollapsible(...)
  If you use custom derived node classes, you need to adjust your code to the 
  new API (have a look at ColorOcTree.h as an example). In particular, you 
  should no longer use the above node member functions in your nodes.
- Extended unit tests for the new memory management
- Added valgrind memcheck suppression file with known ("wanted") leaks due to 
  StaticMemberInitializer.
- Replaced `unsigned short int` for key values with octomap::key_type 
  (=uint16_t) and unsigned char with uint8_t in API.
- Cleaned up OcTreeKey and KeyRay API (used internally)
- Reduced unneeded memory for StaticMemberInitializer 
- Cleaned up const refs to primitive types in ColorOcTree interface
- Removed deprecated insertScan functions (replaced by insertPointCloud)
- Removed no longer used ROS logging macros and unmaintained  OcTreeLUT, 
  OcTreeBaseSE classes
- octovis: Internal version of libQGLViewer updated to 2.6.3

v1.7.2: 2016-03-26
==================

- Fixed #82: Enable uninstall target for complete project
- Fixed #47: Exported CMake library paths for Windows no longer
  have the Release/Debug prefix and correctly contain the .lib file
- Fixed #51: IO factory class registry with MSVC. Calling a dummy 
  function from an OcTree class c'tor enables reading general .ot files
  when compiling with MSVC
- Fixed #100: Explicit casts to avoid warnings with MSVC

v1.7.0: 2015-11-27
==================
- BBX iterators fixed for empty trees (thx to F. Boniardi)
- graph2tree tool option for nodes in global frame

  calling code depending on return value and endpoint voxel)
- Marching cubes for ray surface intersection extended
- Fixed QGLViewer include paths

  updateNode(). You no longer have to call prune(), except when you manually
  change nodes or use lazy_update.
- insertScan() renamed to insertPointCloud(), removed parameter "pruning"
- insertScanNaive() renamed to insertScanRays(), removed parameter "pruning"
- insertScan() / insertPointCloud() / insertScanRays() can now be parallelized
  with OpenMP, currently disabled by default. Enable with CMake flag OCTOMAP_OMP
- Empty octrees no longer contain a root node (#11)
- Library names in CMake configs are now absolute paths, you should no longer
  use OCTOMAP_LIBRARY_DIRS with FIND_PACKAGE (#14)
- graph2tree: pointcloud is transformed in batch before insertion, small changes
  in command line options

	B. Lau, and W. Burgard is now available as part of the OctoMap distribution
- added AbstractOccupancyOcTree interface class, moved binary file IO
- delete functionality added to octrees and nodes

===================
- extended graph2tree with more verbose logging / statistics
- fixed conversion from color .ot to .bt in convert_octree
- minor fixes in octovis with color rendering 
- fixed octovis compilation with Qt 4.8 (Ubuntu 12.04)
- experimental editing functionality in octovis to clear and fill volumes

v1.4.1: 2012-03-12
===================
- added stack.yaml for release in ROS with catkin

v1.4: 2012-02-22
===================
 - New generalized file IO for all kinds of OcTrees to .ot files. The updated
 	file format requires a conversion of your old bt and ot files with the 
 	"convert_octree" tool. bt files are read and written as before. 
 	To write the general .ot file format use tree.write(...) and read it with 
 	AbstractOcTree::read(...) as factory (dynamic_cast to the correct class 
 	afterwards).
 - New ColorOcTree class to store color in addition to occupancy 
	(e.g. from Kinect), with visualization in octovis
 - New map collections of octrees (hierarchical octree maps, experimental)
 - Support for Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows
 - enhancements and fixes in changeDetection
 - minor fixes and unit tests added

v1.2: 2011-08-17
===================
 - divided code into a library (octomap) and visualization part (octvis) to 
	remove dependencies on Qt / OpenGL from library. Both can be built 
	independently or as a complete package.
 - iterators for fast and flexible tree access (check doxygen of OcTreeBase::
	 iterator) are the preferred way to traverse tree nodes now
 - improved speed of map update / scan insertion. A further speedup is possible
	when using the "lazy evaluation" flag for batch insertion
 - unit tests based on CTest ("make test")
 - CMake improvements: new targets "dist" (build package) and "uninstall",
	dynamic and static libs are built. CMake package config to ease integration 
	into other CMake-based systems (install octomap globally, or set the 
	environment variable octomap_DIR to your OctoMap location
 - occupancy and sensor parameters are now a property of the tree and not the
	nodes. Use e.g. tree->isNodeOccupied(node) instead of node->isOccupied()
 - cleanup of OcTree and OccupancyOcTree: the latter now holds most of the 
	implementation to ease deriving own tree and node types. 
        See OcTreeStamped for an example.
 - debug output is now muted when not compiling as "Debug", ROS logging levels
	are used when compiled in ROS
 - experimental change detection in occupancy octrees 
 - bugfixes and general compatibility improvements


v1.0: 2011-03-15
===================
 - cleanup of insertScan methods
 - key-based raycasting with pre-allocated KeyRay
 - speedup and cleanup of math, inlining


v0.8: 2010-11-16
===================
 - improved speed of map update / scan insertion 
 - improved speed of map queries (isOccupied / castRay)
 - key-based computations to improve numerical stability and efficiency
