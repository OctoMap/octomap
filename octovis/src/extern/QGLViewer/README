libQGLViewer is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the creation of OpenGL 3D viewers.

It provides some of the  typical 3D viewer  functionalities, such as the possibility to
move the camera using the mouse, which lacks  in most of the other APIs. Other features
include mouse  manipulated  frames, interpolated  keyFrames,  object selection,  stereo 
display, screenshot saving and much more. It can be used by OpenGL beginners as well as
to create complex applications, being fully customizable and easy to extend.

Based on the Qt  toolkit, it compiles on any architecture  (Unix-Linux, Mac,  Windows). 
Full reference documentation and  many examples are provided.   libQGLViewer  does  not 
display  3D scenes in various formats,  but it can be the base for the coding of such a 
viewer.

libQGLViewer uses dual licensing: it is freely available under the terms of the GNU-GPL
license for open source software development,  while  commercial applications can apply
for a commercial license.


The library's main functionalities are:

     - A camera trackball to intuitively move the camera in the scene.
     - Screenshot saving in different file formats (JPG, PNG, EPS...).
     - Easy scene object selection and manipulation using the mouse.
     - Definition and replay of keyFrame paths.
     - Stereo display (provided that your hardware supports it).
     - Clean, well-designed and easily extendable API.
     - Many examples and a complete reference documentation.
